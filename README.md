Car Price Prediction Project
=======
Project Overview

This project involves building a Car Price Prediction model using Linear Regression. The goal is to predict the listed price of a car based on various features, such as model, year, mileage, and other characteristics. This project helps demonstrate my skills in data preprocessing, regression modeling, and evaluation of machine learning models.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is either the CarDekho dataset or a similar dataset from Kaggle. The data includes both numerical and categorical features that are relevant to car pricing.

Key Features Used

Some of the key features in the dataset that impact car price prediction include:
 • Model year (myear)
 • Kilometers driven (km)
 • Number of cylinders (No of Cylinder)
 • Engine specifications (Max Power Delivered, Max Torque Delivered)
 • Dimensions (Length, Width, Height, etc.)
 • Other features like Top Speed, Acceleration, and Ground Clearance Unladen

Steps in the Project

Step 1: Import Libraries

Standard libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib are imported to handle data manipulation, machine learning modeling, and data visualization.

Step 2: Data Import and Cleaning

 • The dataset is imported, and unnecessary columns are removed to keep only the relevant features for prediction.
 • Categorical data is converted to numeric values where necessary.
 • Missing values are filled with suitable replacements to ensure a clean dataset for training.

Step 3: Feature Scaling

StandardScaler from scikit-learn is used to normalize the data, ensuring all features contribute equally to the model.

Step 4: Data Splitting

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance. A 20% test size is used, with the random state set to ensure reproducibility.

Step 5: Model Creation

Using Polynomial Features with degree 2 to capture non-linear relationships, followed by Linear Regression to build the predictive model.

Step 6: Model Training and Evaluation

 • The model is trained on the training set and then evaluated on the test set.
 • Metrics used to assess model performance include:
 • Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
 • Mean Squared Error (MSE)
 • R2-score

Results

The model’s accuracy and error metrics provide insights into how well it predicts car prices. Future improvements may include experimenting with other algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) and more complex feature engineering.

Requirements

To run this project, you’ll need:
 • Python 3.x
 • Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
